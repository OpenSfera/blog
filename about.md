OpenSfera is a project about run a [growbox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grow_box) with a Raspberry.

I've got a Rasp for fortuity, I'm a software developer and I studied electronics on high school a long long time ago.

 This project is in very early stage and I don't know if can be serious, for now is a way to learn new stuff (Sensors + Mqtt + ReactJS). Before release anything I want to test if it work. This *blog* is to keep track of what happen along the way.

Beautiness it matters but for now I don't want to spend much time on it, I just want to test if
it works so I build a box, plug a cheap [Grow Light](https://www.amazon.com/UMFun-Flower-Indoor-Hydroponics-Spectrum/dp/B074BQXDY6/ref=sr_1_3?s=lawn-garden&ie=UTF8&qid=1511430007&sr=1-3), covered the inside with a reflective material, hooked the hardware and wrote some programs to schedule light hours and check for temperature and humidity.

The plan is to get pairs of plants (inside and outside), the ones inside will get 16h of lights per day, wait some weeks and see what happen.

Here I will collects pictures of progress. If I will reach a good stability of the system I plan to release everything on github.
