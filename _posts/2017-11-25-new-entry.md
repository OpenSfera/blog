On day 01 there was a new entry. An unexpected one.

A vase sown with cucumbers.

According to websearch seed take 7-21 days to sprout, best temperatures are more than 20Â°C.

Well, I actually do not know which is the plants best environment but I know very well in which one they currently live.

I mean, even if you do not know how the plant works, the more experiments you do, more close you get to the best conditions. That's data inference applied to plants.
