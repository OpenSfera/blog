It's Day 8 and is snowing. 40 centimeters of white are covering everything and,at home,
a little turf of anthurium it came off. There is still space in the Sfera so why don't add a new experiment.

According to web search this plant *thrive in daytime temperatures between 80 and 90ºF (27–32ºC). If this is not possible, the plant will typically survive indoors at temperatures above 60ºF (15.5ºC), but warmer is better.[6] Avoid direct sun, which may burn the plant, but keep it in a bright location to encourage blooming.*
I think the direct sun problem is about the UV ray so it should work well.

A feature I didn't expected: I live in a fairly isolated area and when is snowing like today there are blackouts.
Due the lack of magic power, on blackouts Sfera do not work. But *bestfriend* report it :)
