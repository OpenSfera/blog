![Cucumber]({{ "assets/images/20171208/front.png" | absolute_url }})


2nd weeks and something is working!

*Plants do not get any kind of treatment, just the 7W leds light for 16h a day.*

There is still nothing on the cucumber's vase, the seeds have been in for 12 days... may be seeds aren't good.

Picture here are bad for comparison,  I made a mark on the vase to get pictures from the same side ,next time comparison will be easier.



### Fragaria


| day 7 | day 14 |

A lot of new leafs. The two spread they were already there but now they have root.

### Aloe Vera

| day 7 | day 14 |
| ------- | ----- |
| ![Aloe Vera]({{ "assets/images/day_07/aloe_comparison_above.png" | absolute_url }}) | ![Aloe Vera]({{ "assets/images/20171208/aloe_comparison_above.png" | absolute_url }}) |
| ![Aloe Vera]({{ "assets/images/day_07/aloe_comparison_front.png" | absolute_url }}) | ![Aloe Vera]({{ "assets/images/20171208/aloe_comparison_front.png" | absolute_url }}) |
| ![Aloe Vera]({{ "assets/images/day_07/aloe_sprout.png" | absolute_url }}) | ![Aloe Vera]({{ "assets/images/20171208/aloe_sprout.png" | absolute_url }}) |

The central vase is the one inside the Sfera.

There are still no big differences apart from the sprout.

### Pelargonium

| day 7 | day 14 |
|--------|---------|
| ![xxxxx]({{ "assets/images/day_07/pelargonium_inside.png" | absolute_url }}) | ![xxxxx]({{ "assets/images/20171208/pelargonium_inside.png" | absolute_url }}) |

This plant really start the vegetative stage! The one outside is still the same, instead here there are a lot of new sprout everywhere.

### Anthurium

| day 0 | day 6 |
|--------|---------|
| ![xxxxx]({{ "assets/images/20171208/anthurium_before.png" | absolute_url }}) | ![xxxxx]({{ "assets/images/20171208/anthurium.png" | absolute_url }}) |

Leafs are more beautiful.

### Control Panel

As I'm tracking what's going inside I write a little web based journal embedded in **bestfriend**.
Journal keep track of days and custom events.
