![Cucumber]({{ "assets/images/day_07/cucumber.png" | absolute_url }})


It's Day 7. I didn't expect much from the plants, I know that seven days are nothing but it seem something is working.

Starting from now I try to compare always in the same way as this post.

Plants do not get any kind of treatment, just the 7W leds light for 16h a day.

There is nothing on the cucumber's vase but it take 7 to 21 day to germinate, I wait.

### Fragaria

New leafs are growing on the center!!!!

### Aloe Vera

The central vase is the one inside the Sfera.

No big difference, it sound is growing more than the others but may be is just myself. I wait.

There is a sprout, I'm sure it came up before entering in the box but i didn't noticed. Here the detail.

### Pelargonium

That's very difficult to show in pictures without a macro lens (I'm shooting with my mobile)

Both plants has new sprouts but the one inside as lot more.

May be the next week will be better observed. I wait.

*A Note: In those days I found 4 caterpillars.  The others pelargornium are at lower temperature and are free from them (for sure they have eggs inside), according to web search eggs need at least 18Â°C to hatch .*

### Environment

This screenshot show the *"weather conditions"* from yesterday.
