Day Zero. I put in the box:

 - Pelargonium peltatum
 - Aloe vera
 - Fragaria vesca

![inside]({{ "assets/images/day_00_inside.jpg" | absolute_url }})

They don't have a correlation, I'm not an expert, I just try to put together different species.
There is still free space in the box, I think at least to add an orchid (with her twin outside).

I got picture of the inside and the twin outside.
Daylights is set from 06:00 to 22:00. It's 16h of light, sounds like summer.

Pelargonium outside:
