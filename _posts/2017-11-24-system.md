The list of *stuff* used to run a Sfera. I think to add and remove some part, to improve
existent and... well, all the usual bla bla we are used to ear from developers :)

### Hardware

  - Raspberry Pi3 model B v2 (planning to try the Pi0w)
  - Grow Light 7W
  - Relay SDR-05VDC-SL-C
  - DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Logger
  - Reflective mylar film
  - Simple forniture Box
  - wiring cable

### Software

OS is NOOBS but every debian based distro should be ok.

All the software lay on a *mqtt* system with a *mongodb* to persist data.

There are three topics:
  - **local/status**: where the sensors publish the values read from the box
  - **local/system**: where other apps publish some system changes
  - **local/alerts**: where apps publish problems on the system

on those topics there are many apps who live together. Please, think about them as a bunch actor
who play a game.

  - **technician**: (python) the one in charge of the hardware. He turn on electrics and read sensors and publish on **local/status** what's going on.
  - **reporter**: (python) the one who persist the system status.
  - **paramedic**: (nodejs) the one who tell *something is going wrong* but he try to fix it.
  - **insider**: (python) if *paramedic* has very bad time he ask the human.
  - **alertByTelegram**: (python) this is a simple app, it ears for *insider* and send a message on telegram
  - **manager**: (python) the one in charge to change configurations
  - **bestfriend**: (nodejs + express + react) he is your bestfriend. A web interface to hide all the works is done inside :P

All the apps are built to do simple jobs. I wait to publish those apps because they are still embryonic
and need a lot of configuration to works.

**Please note.**
This is all about making new experiences.

- I know few things about growing plants.
- I know few things about electronics.
- I know little things about python.
- I know nothing about MQTT.
- I know something about ReactJS.

As I'm a software developer I mixed technology I already know with some new ones. That's
the way we learn new stuff... making big mistake I mean!
If you spot something wrong, please, let me know.
